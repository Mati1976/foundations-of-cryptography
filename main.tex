\section*{Lecture 1 - Introduction \& Symmetric Cryptosystems}

\subsection*{General}

\begin{itemize}
\item Alice encrypts a message $m$ using key $k$ and encryption algorithm $E$ such that $c = E_k(m)$. Bob decrypts the ciphertext $c$ using the same key $k$ and decryption algorithm  $E\inv$ such that $m = E_k\inv(c)$.
\item Mathematically, a cryptosystem can be defined as a tuple $({\mathcal Gen},{\mathcal {P}}, E, E\inv)$ where:
\begin{itemize}
\item [$\circ$] ${\mathcal Gen}$ is a key generation algorithm for keys in the key space ${\mathcal {K}}$.
\item [$\circ$] ${\mathcal {P}}$ is the set of plaintexts.
\item [$\circ$] $E$ is a deterministic encryption algorithm.
\item [$\circ$] $E\inv$ is a deterministic decryption algorithm.
\end{itemize}
such that $E_k\inv(E_k(m)) = m$ for every message $m \in {\mathcal {P}}$ and $k \in {\mathcal {K}}$
\item The set ${\mathcal {C}} = E_k(m) \mid m \in {\mathcal {P}} \land k \in {\mathcal {K}}$ is called the set of ciphertexts.

(Pronounced: \textit{$E_k(m)$ such that $m$ is in ${\mathcal {P}}$ and $k$ is in ${\mathcal {K}}$.} I.e. all combinations of keys $k$ and messages $m$.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Caesar Cipher}

\begin{itemize}
\item In an alphabet containing 26 letters, the key $k$ is such that $k \in \mathbb{Z}_{26}$.
\item The plaintext $m = (m_1, ..., m_n) \in \mathbb{Z}_{26}^{n}$ gives ciphertext $c = (c_1, ..., c_n)$.
\item Encryption is given by $c_i = m_i + k \mod 26$.
\item Decryption is given by $m_i = c_i - k \mod 26$.
\item The key space ${\mathcal {K}}$ is too small, making it susceptible to brute force attacks.
\item A frequency analysis can be done by maximising the inner product $T(E\inv(C)) \cdot F$ where $T(s) \cdot F$ denotes the frequency table of string $s$ and the English language respectively.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Lecture 2 - More Symmetric Cryptosystems}

\subsection*{Affine Cipher}

\begin{itemize}
\item The key $k$ is given by a random pair $(a, b)$, where $a \in \mathbb{Z}_{26}$ is relatively prime to 26, and $b \in \mathbb{Z}_{26}$.
\item The plaintext $m = (m_1, ..., m_n) \in \mathbb{Z}_{26}^{n}$ gives ciphertext $c = (c_1, ..., c_n)$.
\item Encryption is given by $c_i = am_i + b \mod 26$.
\item Decryption is given by $m_i = (c_i - b)a^{-1} \mod 26$.
\item \textsl{Relative primality of $a$ and 26 implies that $(a^{-1} \mod 26)$ exists.}
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Substitution Cipher}

\begin{itemize}
\item Both the Caesar cipher and affine cipher are examples of substitution ciphers.
\item The key is a random permutation $\sigma \in {\mathcal {S}}$ of the symbols in the alphabet, for some subset ${\mathcal {S}}$ of all permutations.
\item The plaintext $m = (m_1, ..., m_n) \in \mathbb{Z}_{26}^{n}$ gives ciphertext $c = (c_1, ..., c_n)$.
\item Encryption is given by $c_i = \sigma(m_i)$.
\item Decryption is given by $m_i = \sigma^{-1}(c_i)$.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Generic Attacks on Substitution Ciphers}

\begin{itemize}
\item A \textbf{digram} is an ordered pair of symbols.
\item A \textbf{trigram} is an ordered triple of symbols.
\item It is useful to compute frequency tables for the most frequent digrams and trigrams, and not only the frequencies for individual symbols. 

\begin{enumerate}
\item Compute symbol / digram / trigram frequency tables for the candidate language and the ciphertext.
\item Try to match symbols / digrams / trigrams with similar frequencies. 
\item Try to recognise words to confirm guesses (using dictionary or Google).
\item Repeat until the plaintext can be guessed.
\end{enumerate}
\item This is hard when several symbols have similar frequencies - a large amount of cipher text is needed.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Vigenère Cipher}

\begin{itemize}
\item The key is given by $k = (k_0, ..., k_{l - 1})$, where $k_i \in \mathbb{Z}_{26}$ is random.
\item The plaintext $m = (m_1, ..., m_n) \in \mathbb{Z}_{26}^{n}$ gives ciphertext $c = (c_1, ..., c_n)$.
\item Encryption is given by $c_i = m_i + k_{i \mod l} \mod 26$.
\item Decryption is given by $m_i = c_i - k_{i \mod l} \mod 26$.
\item \textsl{This gives a more uniform frequency table.}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Attack on Vigenère Cipher}

\begin{itemize}
\item Each probability distribution $p_1, ..., p_n$ on $n$ symbols may be viewed as a point $p = (p1, ..., p_n)$ on a $n - 1$ dimensional hyperplane in $\mathbb{R}^n$ orthogonal to the vector $\overline{1} = (1, ..., 1)$.
\item Such a point $p = (p_1, ..., p_n)$ is at a distance $\sqrt{F(p)}$ from the origin, where $F(p) = \sum^{n}_{i = 1} p^2_i$.
\item It is clear that $p$ is closest to the origin, when $p$ is the uniform distribution, i.e., when $F(p)$ is minimised.
\item $F(p)$ is invariant under permutation of the underlying symbols. Use tools to check if a set of symbols is the result of some substitution cipher. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item For $l = 1, 2, 3, ...$ we form\\[0.25cm] 
$
\begin{pmatrix}
C_{0} \\
C_{1} \\
\vdots \\
C_{l-1} 
\end{pmatrix} 
=
\begin{pmatrix}
c_{0} & c_{l} & c_{2l} & \cdots \\
c_{1} & c_{l+1} & c_{2l+1} & \cdots \\
\vdots  & \vdots  & \vdots & \ddots \\
c_{l-1} & c_{2l-1} & c_{3l-1} & \cdots 
\end{pmatrix}$\\[0.25cm]
and compute $f_l = \frac{1}{l} \sum^{l-1}_{i=0}F(C_i)$.
\item The local maximum with smallest $l$ is probably the right length.
\item Then attack each $C_i$ separately to recover $k_i$, using the attack against the Caesar cipher.
\end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Hill Cipher}

\begin{itemize}
\item The key is given by $k = A$, where $a$ is an invertible $l \times l$-matrix over $\mathbb{Z}_{26}$.
\item The plaintext $m = (m_1, ..., m_n) \in \mathbb{Z}_{26}^{n}$ gives ciphertext $c = (c_1, ..., c_n)$.
\item Encryption is given by $(c_{i+0}, ..., c_{i+l-1}) = (m_{i+0}, ..., m_{i+l-1})A$.
\item Decryption is given by $(c_{i+0}, ..., c_{i+l-1}) = (m_{i+0}, ..., m_{i+l-1})A^{-1}$.\\[0.25cm]
for $i = 1, l + 1, 2l + 1, ...$
\item The Hill cipher is easy to break using a \textbf{known plaintext attack}.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Permutation Cipher}

\begin{itemize}
\item The permutation cipher is a special case of the Hill cipher.
\item The key is given by a random permutation $\pi \in \mathcal{S}$ for some subset $\mathcal{S}$ of the set of permutation of $\{0, 1, 2, ..., l -1\}$.
\item The plaintext $m = (m_1, ..., m_n) \in \mathbb{Z}_{26}^{n}$ gives ciphertext $c = (c_1, ..., c_n)$.
\item Encryption is given by $c_i = m_{\lfloor i / l \rfloor + \pi (i \mod l)}$.
\item Decryption is given by $m_i = c_{\lfloor i / l \rfloor + \pi^{-1} (i \mod l)}$.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Summary of Simple Ciphers}

\begin{itemize}
\item Caesar cipher and affine cipher: $m_i \mapsto am_i + b$.
\item Substitution cipher (generalise Caesar / affine): $m_i \mapsto \sigma(m_i)$.
\item Vigenère cipher (more uniform frequency table): $m_i \mapsto m_i + k_{i \mod l}$.
\item Hill cipher (invertible linear map): $(m_1, ..., m_l) \mapsto (m_1, ..., ..., m_l)A$.
\item Transposition cipher (permutation): $(m_1, ..., m_l) \mapsto (m_{\pi(1)}, ..., m_{\pi(l)})$\\
equivalent to: $(m_1, ..., m_l) \mapsto (m_1, ..., m_l)M_\pi$.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Good Block Ciphers}

\begin{itemize}
\item Simple ciphers are bad, but what makes a good block cipher?
\item For every key a block-cipher with plaintext / ciphertext space $\{0, 1\}^n$ gives a permutation of $\{0, 1\}^n$.
\begin{itemize}
\item [$\circ$] What would be a good cipher?
\end{itemize}
\item A good cipher is one where each key gives a \textbf{randomly chosen permutation} of $\{0, 1\}^n$.
\begin{itemize}
\item [$\circ$] Why is this not possible?
\end{itemize}
\item The representation of a single typical function $\{0, 1\}^n \rightarrow \{0, 1\}^n$ requires roughly $n2^n$ bits $(147 \times 10^{6 \cdot 3}$ for $n = 64)$.
\begin{itemize}
\item [$\circ$] What should we look for instead?
\end{itemize}
\item \textbf{Idea:} Compose smaller weak ciphers into a large one. Mix the components thoroughly. Claude Shannon (1948) introduces two terms:
\begin{itemize}
\item [$\circ$] \textbf{Diffusion:} "In the method of diffusion the statistical structure of $M$ which leads to its redundancy is dissipated into long range statistics..."
\item [$\circ$] \textbf{Confusion:} "The method of confusion is to make the relation between the simple statistics of $E$ and the simple description of $K$ a very complex and involved one."
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section*{Lecture 3 - Substitution-Permutation Networks \& AES}

\subsection*{Substitution-Permutation Networks}

\begin{itemize}
\item Block-size: We use a block-size of $n = l \times m$ bits.
\item Key Schedule: Round $r$ uses its own round key $K_r$ derived from the key $K$ using a key schedule.
\item Each Round the following is invoked:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Round Key: xor with the round key.
\item Substitution: $l$ substitution boxes each acting on one $m$-bit word ($m$-bit S-Boxes).
\item Permutation: A permutation $\pi_i$ acting on $\{1, ..., n\}$ to reorder the $n$ bits.
\end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{A Simple Block Cipher}

\begin{itemize}
\item $|P| = |C| = 16$
\item 4 rounds
\item $|K| = 32$
\item $r$\ts{th} round key $K_r$ consists of the 4$r$\ts{th} to the $(4r + 16)$\ts{th} bits of key $K$.
\item 4-bit S-Boxes
\item S-Boxes the same $(S \neq S\inv)$
\item $Y = S(X)$
\item Can be described using 4 boolean functions.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)}

\begin{itemize}
\item Chosen in worldwide public competition 1997-2000. Probably no backdoors. Increased confidence!
\item Winning proposal named "Rijndael", by Rijmen and Daemen.
\item Family of 128-bit ciphers: \{Key bits, Rounds\} - \{128, 10\}, \{192, 12\}, \{256, 14\}. 
\item The first key-recovery attacks on full AES found by Bogdanov, Khovratovich, and Rechberger was published in 2011 and is faster than brute force by a factor of about 4. 
\item The algebraics of AES have made some people \textit{uneasy}, but they have been uneasy for years now...
\begin{itemize}
\item [$\circ$] AddRoundKey: xor with round key.
\item [$\circ$] SubBytes: Substitution of bytes.
\item [$\circ$] ShiftRows: Permutation of bytes.
\item [$\circ$] MixXolumns: Linear map.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item The 128 bit state is interpreted as a $4 \times 4$ matrix of bytes.
\begin{center}
\input{matrix.tex}
\end{center}
\item Something like a mix between substitution, permutation, affine version of Hill cipher. In each round!
\item SubBytes is a field inversion in $\mathbb{F}_{2^8}$ plus affine map in $\mathbb{F}_{2}^8$.
\item ShiftRows is ac cyclic shift of bytes with offsets: 0, 1, 2, and 3.
\item MixColumns is an invertible linear map over $\mathbb{F}_{2^8}$ (with irreducible polynomial $x^8 + x^4 +x^3 + x + 1)$ with good diffusion. 
\item Decryption uses the following transforms:
\begin{itemize}
\item [$\circ$] AddRoundKey
\item [$\circ$] InvSubBytes
\item [$\circ$] InvShiftRows
\item [$\circ$] InvMixColumns
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Feistel Networks}

\begin{itemize}
\item Identical rounds are iterated, but with different round keys.
\item The input to the $i$\ts{th} round is divided in a left and right part, denoted $L^{i-1}$ and $R^{i-1}$.
\item $f$ is a function for which it is somewhat hard to find pre-images, but $f$ is \textbf{not invertible}!
\item One round is defined by:\\ 
$L^i = R^{i-1}$\\$R^i = L^{i-1} \oplus f(R^{i-1}, K^i)$\\
where $K^i$ is the $i$\ts{th} round key.
\item The inverse Feistel round is given by:\\ 
$L^{i-1} = R^i \oplus f(L^i, K^i)$\\$R^{i-1} = L^i$\\
I.e. reverse direction and swap left and right.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Data Encryption Standard (DES)}
\begin{itemize}
\item Developed at IBM in 1975, or perhaps at NSA; not publicly known.
\item 16-round Feistel network.
\item Key schedule derives permuted bits for each round key from a 56-bit key. Supposedly not 64-bit due to parity bits.
\item DES's $f$-Function is given by: $f(R^{i-1}, K^i)$
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Security of DES}
\begin{itemize}
\item Brute Force: Try all $2^56$ keys. Done in practice with special chip by Electronic Frontier Foundation, 1998. Possibly much earlier by NSA and others.
\item Differential Cryptanalysis: $2^{47}$ chosen plaintexts, Biham and Shamir, 1991. Known earlier by IBM and NSA. DES is surprisingly resistant!
\item Linear Cryptanalysis: $2^{43}$ known plaintexts, Matsui, 1993. Probably \textbf{not} known by IBM and NSA!
\item Since the key space for DES is too small, one way to increase it is to use DES twice, so called "double DES".
$2DES_{k_1,k_2}(x) = DES_{k_2}(DES_{k_1}(x))$.
\item However, this is \textbf{not} more secure than normal DES! 
\item Meet-in-the-middle attack:
\begin{itemize}
\item [$\circ$] Get hold of a plaintext-ciphertext pair $(m, c)$.
\item [$\circ$] Compute $X = \{x \mid k_1 \in \mathcal{K}_{DES} \land x = E_{k_1}(m) \}$.
\item [$\circ$] For $k_2 \in \mathcal{K}_{DES}$ check if $E_{k_2}^{-1}(c) = E_{k_1}(m)$ for some $k_1$ using the table $X$. If so, then $(k_1, k_2)$ is a good candidate.
\item [$\circ$] Repeat with $(m', c')$, starting from the set of candidate keys to identify the correct key.
\end{itemize}
\item Tripple DES: $3DES_{k_1,k_2,k_3}(x) = DES_{k_3}(DES_{k_2}(DES_{k_1}(x)))$.
\item Seemingly 112 bit "effective" key size.
\item 3 times as slow as DES. DES is slow in software, and this is even worse. One of the motivation for AES. 
\item Triple DES is sill considered to be secure.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Modes of Operation}
\begin{itemize}
\item 5 modes of operation:
\begin{itemize}
\item [$\circ$] Electronic codebook mode (ECB mode).
\item [$\circ$] Cipher feedback mode (CFB mode).
\item [$\circ$] Cipher block chaining mode (CBC mode).
\item [$\circ$] Output feedback mode (OFB mode).
\item [$\circ$] Counter mode (CTR mode).
\end{itemize}
\item \textbf{Electronic codebook mode} - encrypt each block independently: $c_i = E_k(m_i)$.
\item Identical plaintext blocks give identical ciphertext blocks.
\item \textbf{Cipher feedback mode} - xor plaintext block with previous ciphertext block \textbf{after} encryption:\\$c_0 =$ initialisation vector\\$c_i = m_i \oplus E_k(c_{i-1})$.
\item Sequential encryption and parallel decryption.
\item Self-synchronising and unidirectional.
\item \textbf{Cipher block chaining mode} - xor plaintext block with previous ciphertext block \textbf{after} encryption:\\$c_0 =$ initialisation vector\\$c_i = E_k(c_{i-1} \oplus m_i)$.
\item Sequential encryption and parallel decryption.
\item Self-synchronising.
\item \textbf{Output feedback mode} - generate stream, xor plaintexts with stream (emulate "one-time pad"):\\$s_0 =$ initialisation vector\\$s_i = E_k(s_{i-1})$\\$c_i = s_i \oplus m_i$.
\item Sequential. 
\item Synchronous.
\item Allows batch processing.
\item Malleable!
\item \textbf{Counter mode} - generate stream, xor plaintexts with stream (emulate "one-time pad"):\\$s_0 =$ initialisation vector\\$s_i = E_k(s_{0} || i)$\\$c_i = s_i \oplus m_i$.
\item Parallel.
\item Synchronous.
\item allows batch processing.
\item Malleable!
\end{itemize}

\section*{Lecture 4 - Cryptanalysis of the Simple Permutation Network}

\begin{itemize}
\item Find an expression of the following form with a high probability of occurrence. 
$$P_{i_1} \oplus \cdots \oplus P_{i_p} \oplus C_{j_1} \oplus \cdots \oplus C_{j_c} = K_{l_1, s_1} \oplus \cdots \oplus K_{l_k, s_k}$$
\item Each random plaintext / ciphertext pair gives an estimate of $$K_{l_1, s_1} \oplus \cdots \oplus K_{l_k, s_k}$$
\item Collect many pairs and make a better estimate based on the majority vote.
\item How do we come up with the desired expression?
\item How do we compute the required number of samples?
\end{itemize}
\subsection*{Bias}
\begin{itemize}
\item The bias $\epsilon(X)$ of a binary random variable $X$ is defined by $$\epsilon(X) = Pr [X = 0] - \frac{1}{2}$$
$\approx 1 / \epsilon^2(X)$ samples are required to estimate $X$.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Linear Approximation of S-Box}
\begin{itemize}
\item Let $X$ and $Y$ be the input and output of an $S$-box, i.e. {\boldmath$Y = S(X)$}.
\item We consider the bias of linear combinations of the form $$a \cdot X \oplus b \cdot Y = \Bigg(\bigoplus_{i}a_iX_i\Bigg) \oplus \Bigg(\bigoplus_{i}b_iY_i\Bigg)$$
\item Example: $X_2 \oplus X_3 = Y_1 \oplus Y_3 \oplus Y_4$. The expression holds in 12 out of the 16 cases. Hence, it has a bias of (12-8)/16 = 4/16 = 1/4.
\item Let $N_L(a, b)$ be the number of zero-outcomes of a $a \cdot X \oplus b \cdot Y$.
\item The bias is then $$\epsilon(a \cdot X \oplus b \cdot Y = \frac{N_L(a,b) - 8}{16},$$ since there are four bits in $X$, and $Y$ is determined by $X$.
\item This gives a linear approximation for one round.
\item How do we come up with a linear approximation for more rounds?
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Piling-Up Lemma}

\begin{itemize}
\item Let $X1, ..., X_t$ be independent binary random variables and let $\epsilon_i = \epsilon(X_i)$. Then $$\epsilon \Bigg(\bigoplus_{i}X_i\Bigg) = 2^{t-1} \prod_{i} \epsilon_i .$$ 
\item Proof: Case $t = 2$:
\begin{align*}
Pr[X_1 \oplus X_2 = 0] &= Pr[X_1 = 0 \land X_1 = 0) \lor (X_1 = 1 \land X_1 = 1)]\\
&= (\frac{1}{2} + \epsilon_1)(\frac{1}{2} + \epsilon_2)+(\frac{1}{2} - \epsilon_1)(\frac{1}{2} - \epsilon_2)\\
&=\frac{1}{2} + 2\epsilon_1 \epsilon_2.
\end{align*}
By induction $Pr[X_1 \oplus \cdots \oplus X_t = 0] = \frac{1}{2} + 2^{t-1}\prod_{i} \epsilon_i$
\end{itemize}
\subsection*{Attacking a Linear Trail}
\begin{itemize}
\item Four linear approximations with $|\epsilon_i| = 1/4$
\begin{align*}
S_{12} &: X_1 \oplus X_3 \oplus X_4 = Y_2\\
S_{22} &: X_2 = Y_2 \oplus Y_4\\
S_{32} &: X_2 = Y_2 \oplus Y_4\\
S_{24} &: X_2 = Y_2 \oplus Y_4
\end{align*}
Combine them to get:
$$U_{4,6} \oplus U_{4,8} \oplus U_{4,14} \oplus U_{4,16} \oplus P_5 \oplus P_7 \oplus P_8 = \bigoplus K_{i,j}$$
with bias $|\epsilon| = 2^{4-1}(\frac{1}{4})^4 = 2^{-5}$
\item Our expression (with bias $2^{-5}$) links plaintext bits to input bits to the 4\ts{th} round.
\item Partially undo the last round by guessing the last key. Only 2 S-Boxes are involved, i.e., $2^8 = 256$ guesses.
\item For a correct guess, the question holds with bias $2^{-5}$. For a wrong guess, it holds with a bias zero (harmless lie).
\item Required pairs $2^{10} \approx 1000$. Attack complexity $2^{18} \ll 2^{32}$ operations.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Linear Cryptanalysis Summary}
\begin{itemize}
\item Linear Cryptanalysis is a \textbf{known plaintext attack}.
\begin{itemize}
\item [$\circ$] Find linear approximation of S-Boxes.
\item [$\circ$] Compute bias of each approximation.
\item [$\circ$] Find linear trails.
\item [$\circ$] Compute bias of linear trails.
\item [$\circ$] Compute data and time complexity.
\item [$\circ$] Estimate key bits from many plaintext-ciphertext pairs.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Ideal Block Cipher}

\begin{itemize}
\item A function $\epsilon(n)$ is negligible if for every constant $c > 0$, there exists a constant $n_0$, such that $$\epsilon(n) < \frac{1}{n^c}$$ for all $n \geq n_0$.
\item Motivation: Events happening with negligible probability can not be exploited by polynomial time algorithms! (they "never" happen!)
\item Caveat! Theoretic notion. Interpret with care in practice.
\item A function is pseudo-random if no efficient adversary can distinguish between the function and a random function.
\item A family of functions $F: \{0,1\}^k \times \{0,1\}^n \rightarrow \{0,1\}^n$ is pseudo-random if for all polynomial time oracle adversaries $A$
$$\Bigg|\Pr_{K} \Big[A^{F_K(\cdot)}=1 \Big] - \Pr_{R:\{0,1\}^n \rightarrow \{0,1\}^n} \Big[A^{R(\cdot)}=1\Big] \Bigg|$$ is negligible.
\item A permutation and its inverse are pseudo-random if no efficient adversary can distinguish between the permutation and its inverse, and a random permutation and its inverse.
\item A family of permutations $P: \{0,1\}^k \times \{0,1\}^n \rightarrow \{0,1\}^n$ is pseudo-random if for all polynomial time oracle adversaries $A$
$$\Bigg|\Pr_{K} \Big[A^{P_K(\cdot),P_K^{-1}(\cdot)}=1 \Big] - \Pr_{\Pi \in {\mathcal S}_{2^n}} \Big[A^{\Pi(\cdot),\Pi^{-1}(\cdot)}=1\Big] \Bigg|$$ 
is negligible, where ${\mathcal S}_{2^n}$ is the set of permutations of $\{0,1\}^n$.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Idealised Four-Round Feistel Network}

\begin{itemize}
\item Feistel round ($H$ for "Horst Feistel").
$$H_{F_K}(L,R) = (R, L \oplus F(R,K))$$
\item Theorem: (Luby and Rackoff) If $F$ is a pseudo-random family of functions, then
$$H_{F_{k_1},F_{k_2},F_{k_3},F_{k_4}}(x) = H_{F_{k_4}}(H_{F_{k_3}}(H_{F_{k_2}}(H_{F_{k_1}}(x))))$$ (and its inverse) is a pseudo-random family of permutations.
\item Why do we need four rounds?
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Perfect Secrecy}
\begin{itemize}
\item When is a cipher perfectly secure?
\item How should we formalise this?
\item A cryptosystem has perfect secrecy if guessing the plaintext is equally hard to do regardless of whether or not the ciphertext is given.
\item A cryptosystem has perfect secrecy if $$Pr[M = m \mid C = c] = Pr[M = m]$$ for every $m \in {\mathcal M}$ and $c \in {\mathcal C}$, where $M$ and $C$ are random variables taking values over ${\mathcal M}$ and ${\mathcal C}$.
\item Game Based Definition: $Exp_A^b$, where $A$ is a strategy:
\begin{itemize}
\item [$\circ$] $k \leftarrow_R {\mathcal K}$
\item [$\circ$] $(m_0, m_1) \leftarrow A$
\item [$\circ$] $c = E_k(m_b)$
\item [$\circ$] $d\leftarrow A(c)$, with $d \in \{0,1\}$
\item [$\circ$] Output $d$.
\end{itemize}
\item A cryptossystem has perfect secrecy if for every computationally unbounded strategy $A$, $$Pr[Exp_A^0 = 1] = Pr[Exp^1_A = 1].$$
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{One-Time Pad (OTP)}
\begin{itemize}
\item The key is given by a random tuple $k = (b_0, ..., b_{n-1}) \in \mathbb{Z}_{2}^{n}$.
\item The plaintext $m = (m_0, ..., m_{n-1}) \in \mathbb{Z}_{2}^{n}$ gives ciphertext $c = (c_0, ..., c_{n-1})$.
\item Encryption is given by $c_i = m_i \oplus b_i$.
\item Decryption is given by $m_i = c_i \oplus b_i$.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Bayes' Theorem and OTP's Perfect Secrecy}
\begin{itemize}
\item If $A$ and $B$ are events and $Pr[B] > 0$, then $$Pr[A \mid B] = \frac{Pr[A]Pr[B \mid A]}{Pr[B]}$$
\item Probabilistic Argument. Bayes implies that:
\begin{align*}
Pr[M = m \mid C = c] &= \frac{Pr[M = m]Pr[C = c \mid M = m]}{Pr[C=c]}\\
&=Pr[M = m]\frac{2^{-n}}{2^{-n}}\\
&=Pr[M=m].
\end{align*}
\item Simulation Argument: The ciphertext is uniformly and independently distributed form the plaintext. We can simulate it on our own!
\item Bad News! "For every cipher with perfect secrecy, the key requires at least as much space to represent as the plaintext."
\begin{itemize}
\item [$\circ$] Dangerous in practice to rely on no reuse of, e.g., file containing randomness!
\end{itemize}
